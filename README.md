# Payfast Payment Gateway Module

## About
The Payfast Payment Gateway Module allows you to conduct payments using the PayFast Payment Gateway. This module allows payments with many different payment methods (See at: https://payfast.io/features/payment-methods/)

## Setup
To use this module on your site, you need to create a merchant account on payfast (https://registration.payfast.io/). 

- After creating your account, you will need to access your merchant details (MerchantID, MerchantKey and Passphrase (Optional)).
- Enter these details in the Configuration of the module.
- You're all set up!

NOTE: Split payments and recurring payments are still under development (looking to release in v2.0). To enable them, uncomment the code in payfast.php.
